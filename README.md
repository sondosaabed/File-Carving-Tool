This project was done as part of the Digital Forensics Analysis coursework, specifically the file carving tool.

# File-Carving-Tool
This project aims to develop a File carving Tool. To allow users to perform file fragmentation, hashing, and reconstructing the file. The project is implemented in java.
This report documents the development process of this project, it contains 4 parts. The first part is concerned with image creation and file choosing. Part two is about searching the file using its signature. Part 3, is about fragmentations and hashing of each of the files. Finally, a suggestion for enhancement is made.
